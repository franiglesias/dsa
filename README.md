## Project to learn and practice Data structures and algorithms

Based on this book:

Barnett, G. and Del Tongo, L. (2008) Data Structures and Algorithms: Annotated Reference with Examples

http://lib.mdp.ac.id/ebook/Karya%20Umum/Dsa.pdf

This is a simple project to learn data structures and algorithms implementing them in PHP OOP. I failed in a technical test for a job because of this, so I need to practice the basics.

I will try to work on a single Data Structure or Algorithm every day and build a class that implements it.
